## Weather API
### *Visualize weather of 600 cities around the world based on their distance from the equator and use ideal weather conditions to filter down to five hotels in cities meeting those optimal criteria.* 
Generated list of over 600 cities by randomizing latitudes and longitudes and locating the nearest city. Performed API call from OpenWeatherMap API to check weather conditions in those cities. Created data frame containing cities and their respective weather conditions. Visualized regressions for weather conditions as they related to distance from the equator. Leveraged gmaps to create heat map of humidity levels for cities. Utilized GooglePlaces API to locate and map the nearest hotel in five cities meeting specific ideal weather conditions
Tools used: Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, OpenWeatherMap API, GooglePlaces API
